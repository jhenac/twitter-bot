Twitter Bot

The bot checks for the internet speeds and compares it to the promised speeds of the internet provider.
If the current speeds are above or equal to the promised speeds, it will tweet an appreciation tweet
to the ISP for delivering the promised mbps. Otherwise, it will tweet to complain about the slow 
internet speeds.
